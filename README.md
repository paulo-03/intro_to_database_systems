# Intro to Database Systems (CS-322)

## Description

In this repository, you will found the semester project (split in parts named "deliverable_{int}") of the course CS-322 at EPFL. 

The first part (deliverable_1) of the project analyze the dataset and extract the ER (Entity-Relationship) model, translate it to a Relational Schema, and explain which elements of the dataset need to be cleaned and how it should be modified to follow our relational schema, with reasonable assumptions based on the available data.

The second part (deliverable_1 & deliverable_2) of the project starts with an ER model and relational schema that is provide to us, with the data cleaned and ready to use. We created the database on a server based on some specifications, load the data, and then continue with querying to find certain insights and optimize certain queries to get acquainted with DBMS and the query optimizer.
